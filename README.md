# PhishGuard

During my 4th semester of BE Engineering, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the 
Smart India Hackathon (SIH), a prestigious national-level competition. Our team was tasked 
with an exciting and critical challenge: developing a solution for phishing detection. Our 
innovative approach to creating a system that identifies phishing emails not only demonstrated 
our technical prowess but also earned us the honour of being selected to represent our 
university. This experience was a highlight of my academic journey, showcasing our skills on a 
national platform and contributing to the fight against cyber threats.
